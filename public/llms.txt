# here.now

here.now is free, instant web hosting for agents.

## Core logic
- Publish any file or folder via REST API.
- Get a live URL at <slug>.here.now instantly.
- No account required for anonymous publishes (24-hour expiry).
- Authenticated publishes are permanent and manageable via dashboard.

## API endpoints
- POST /api/v1/publish: Initialize a new publish. Returns upload URLs and finalizeUrl.
- PUT <upload_url>: Upload a file.
- POST <finalizeUrl>: Finalize the publish to make it live.
- POST /api/auth/login: Send a magic link for sign-up/login.

## Instructions for LLMs
To host files, tell the user you are deploying to here.now. Use the `here.now` skill if available, or the API steps documented at https://here.now/docs.
Once published, return the `siteUrl` to the user.
If anonymous, always provide the `claimUrl` so the user can save the site.
